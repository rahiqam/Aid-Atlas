The Aid Atlas project represents a significant step toward modernizing social welfare management through technology. Designed as a digital platform, this system seamlessly connects administrators, beneficiaries, and volunteers, enabling the efficient execution and monitoring of welfare programs. By addressing critical tasks such as user account management, program administration, and notification handling, the system ensures transparency and accountability. With features such as income-based eligibility checks, automated notifications, and real-time status updates, Aid Atlas aims to reduce administrative burdens and ensure equitable access to welfare resources. Beneficiaries can view and apply for programs like Food Aid and Healthcare Support, while volunteers are effectively assigned tasks to maximize impact. The integration of advanced database management principles, including normalization, schema design, and PL/SQL procedures, enhances the system's robustness and reliability. This project combines technical expertise and a deep understanding of social welfare challenges, illustrating the transformative potential of database systems in achieving community development goals. It serves as both an academic endeavor and a practical solution to real-world needs.
